```{r}
data(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
oj <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ",]
vc <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC",]
p05 <-ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == .5,] 
p1 <-ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == 1,]
p2 <-ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == 2,]
t.test(oj$len - vc$len)
t.test(p05$len)$conf.int
t.test(p1$len)$conf.int
t.test(p2$len)$conf.int
```

A oj - vs t test is done. This checks if the difference is not equal to zero. The p-value is .003, so we can safely reject the null hypothesis. Also, as the confidence interval is positive, the oj creates longer odontoblasts compared to the vc treatment. 

A confidence interval is calculated for the other 3. Each of the t tests can be ran to verify that the p values are low enough to be significant. The main takeaway is that a larger dose results in a larger mean, and that they all have similar confidence interval ranges (from 3 to 4). This means that more vitamin C likely results in increased tooth growth.
